# Done

In this stage, the following is to be done:

* After the **Coordinator** reviews the submission made by the Reviewer&#x73;**,** the status of the proposal is changed to <mark style="background-color:orange;">**DONE**</mark> on the spreadsheet if there are no issues with the proposal.
* The **Coordinators** aggregate all audited and finalized reviews in a spreadsheet.
* The spreadsheet is then sent to the **Deep Funding team**.
