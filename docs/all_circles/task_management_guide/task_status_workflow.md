## 🧑‍💼 Coordinator Responsibilities

* ✅ Move tasks from Pending → New (to approve tasks).
* ❌ Move tasks from Pending → Rejected (if task is not approved).
* 🔍 Review tasks in Done and:
  * Move to Audited (if approved after review).\
    \


## 🧑‍🔧 Member Responsibilities

*   Once the task is moved to New, the Assignee can:

    * Move it to In progress when starting.
    * Move it to Done once completed.
    * Move it to On hold if work is paused.



❗️ Important: Members can only move cards if they are the assignee of that task.
