# Steps for Circle Members

*   All members are granted access to their respective Circle’s project in OpenProject once they have been successfully added to the backend system.

    If you are unable to access or view your Circle’s project, please report the issue by creating a support ticket and reaching out through the **IT Support** channel on **Mattermost**.

    Prompt reporting ensures timely resolution and uninterrupted collaboration within your Circle.

<mark style="background-color:red;">Creating Tasks in OpenProject</mark>

* Once you have access to your Circle’s project in OpenProject, you are expected to **create your tasks under the "Work Packages"** section.\
  \
  This ensures visibility, accountability, and effective coordination within your Circle.\
  \
  📝 **Tip for Task Creation:**\
  When creating a task, make sure to fill in the following details:

> - **Title** – Clearly describe what the task is about.
> - **Description** – Provide context, objectives, and any relevant information.
> - **Assignee** – Assign the task to **yourself** to reflect your responsibility.
> - **Accountability** – Assign the task to your circle's coordinator.
> - **Start and Finish Dates** – Always set both to help with planning, timelines and successful payment.
> - **Circle** – Select the appropriate Circle to categorize the task.
> - **Task Category** – Choose a relevant category (e.g., Coordination, Documentation, Support).
> - **Recurring** – Mark this **only if the task is repeated regularly** (e.g., weekly updates).

Accurate and complete task entries facilitates smooth prayment process.
